This program shows how to access the Temporal Memory directly by demonstrating
how to create a TM instance, train it with vectors, get predictions, and
inspect the state.

The code here runs a very simple version of sequence learning, with one
cell per column. The TM is trained with the simple sequence A->B->C->D->E

HOMEWORK: once you have understood exactly what is going on here, try changing
cellsPerColumn to 4. What is the difference between once cell per column and 4
cells per column?
